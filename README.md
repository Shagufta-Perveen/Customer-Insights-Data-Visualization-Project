# ðŸ§  Customer Insights & Data Visualization Project

This project is part of my coursework for the "Tools & Techniques of Data Science" module. The aim is to explore, clean, and visualize customer data using Python, with a focus on real-world scenarios such as identifying invalid records, saving filtered data to JSON, and gaining business insights through visual analytics.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python (3.x)
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook
- JSON handling
- Markdown for documentation

## ðŸ“Š Key Features

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Identified and removed customers with invalid credit card information (e.g., cards active >10 years).
   - Fixed formatting issues in date fields.
   - Exported filtered datasets to `remove_ccard.json`.

2. **Data Analysis**
   - Computed statistics such as mean salary and median age.
   - Corrected and added missing fields (like `Age`) in Excel before loading the dataset.

3. **Visualizations**
   - Univariate and multivariate plots using Seaborn:
     - Age distribution
     - Dependents data cleaning
     - Age vs Salary
     - Commute distance vs Salary
     - Age vs Salary by number of Dependents

4. **Exporting Plots**
   - All generated plots are saved and included in the final submission ZIP.

## ðŸ“‚ Deliverables
- `task2.ipynb` â€” Clean, commented, and structured Jupyter Notebook
- `remove_ccard.json` â€” Customers with problematic credit cards
- Visualization figures in PNG format
- Markdown documentation

## ðŸ“ˆ Outcome
This project demonstrates real-world data wrangling and visualization skills essential for understanding customer behavior and improving decision-making in business scenarios.
